# Jennifer Betzer — Website Demo

This repository contains an early-stage concept website for **Jennifer Betzer**, harpist and educator.

The purpose of this demo is to explore overall tone, layout, typography, photography, and motion before committing to final content or structure. All copy and imagery should be considered provisional unless otherwise noted.

## Scope
- Visual direction and hierarchy
- Typography pairing and spacing
- Hero presentation with subtle motion
- General layout feel across devices

This is not intended to be a complete or finalized site.

## Notes
- Imagery may be placeholder or temporary
- Content will evolve based on feedback
- Structure is intentionally minimal at this stage

## Deployment
The site is deployed via GitHub Pages for easy review and iteration.
